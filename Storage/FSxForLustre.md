# FSx For Lustre

* Fully `managed` `high-performance` `file system` for `compute-intensive` workloads.
* `Compatible` with the [Lustre File System](../Databases.md#lustre-file-system), commonly used in `HPC` (High Performance Computing).

## Key Features

* **High-performance storage**
* **POSIX-compliant**
    * Supports Linux-based applications.
* **Integrates with S3**
    * Can link a Lustre file system to an S3 bucket, allowing processing of S3 data without moving it manually.
* **Scalable storage & throughput**
    * Can scale storage and performance independently.
* **Automatic backups**
    * Daily or on-demand snapshots supported.
* **Multi-AZ deployment**
    * Optional for high availability.

## Use Cases
**HPC workloads**: genomics, simulations, financial risk modeling.

**Machine learning**: preprocessing large datasets.

**Media processing**: video rendering or analytics.

**Big data analytics**: fast temporary scratch storage for datasets.
