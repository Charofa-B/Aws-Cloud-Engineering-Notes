# What Is It
* Provides the `ability` to `create` and `manage` `cryptographic keys`
* Uses [hardware security modules (HSMs)](../Security.md#hsm) to `protect` your `keys`
* `Integrates` with other AWS `services`
* Set `usage policies` to `determine` which `users` can `use keys`

<br><br>

# Features
* **Key Management**
    * `Customer-Managed Keys`
        * KMS manages and protects the cryptographic keys
    * Services can use `pre-existing KMS keys` to `protect` `resources` across multiple `accounts`.
* **Data Key Generation**
    * Generate unique `symmetric` data keys for `encrypting large datasets` or `other encryption keys` (can be used `outside` of KMS)
    * Create `asymmetric` key pairs for `advanced cryptographic` operations

<br><br>

# Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)
* KMS key that `you create, own, and manage`.
* The main `resource type` in KMS and represents the `top-level logical key object that can be used to encrypt/decrypt` data or `generate data keys`.

## Features
* **Full Control Over Key Lifecycle**
    * You create, disable, rotate, and delete the key.
* **Custom Key Policies & Permissions**
    * Define who can use the key (for encryption/decryption).
    * Define who can administer the key (rotate, delete, etc.).
* **Separation of Duties**
* **Integration Across AWS**

<br><br>

# Automatically Rotation
* Automatically rotate Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) once per year.
* Enable it per key â€” KMS handles the rest.
* Automatic rotation is not available for AWS-managed keys; only for CMKs.

<br><br>

# Key Concept
## Encrypt
* Encrypts `plaintext data` up to `4096 bytes (4Kb)` using `your managed key (Customer Managed Key CMK)`
* Supports both `symmetric` and `asymmetric` KMS `keys`
* Encrypting `small amounts` of sensitive data like `passwords`, `identifiers`, or other `confidential information`.

## GenerateDataKey
* Returns a `unique symmetric` data key for `external use`.
* Provides both `plaintext` and `encrypted (using the specified KMS key) versions of the data key`.

## GenerateDataKeyPair
* Returns a `unique asymmetric` data key pair for `external use`.
* Provides `plaintext public` and `private keys`, along with an `encrypted version of the private key`

## Decrypt
* Decrypts `ciphertext` previously `encrypted` by a `KMS key` using operations like Encrypt, GenerateDataKey, etc.
* For `asymmetric keys`, you must `specify the key` and the `encryption algorithm` used.

## SSM
* `Secure string type` with encryption using AWS KMS.

# Key Policies vs IAM Policies
* Key policies are `resource-based` policies that define who can access the key.
* IAM policies are `identity-based`, controlling user/role actions.

<br><br>

# Encryption in Transit vs At Rest
* KMS covers at-rest encryption.
* For in-transit encryption, services use `TLS`.
