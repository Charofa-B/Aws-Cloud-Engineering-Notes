# OpsWorks

* `Configuration management` service that uses [Chef and Puppet](../Infrastructure-Automation.md#chef-and-puppet-automation) (automation frameworks).
* Helps you `automate server configuration`, `deployment`, and `management` across EC2 or on-premises servers.

## Features

* **Supports Chef & Puppet**
* **OpsWorks Stacks**
    * Lets you `model and manage` your application as a `stack`.
    * Each stack `contains layers` (e.g., load balancer, app server, DB).
* **Automation**
    * `Automatically scale` instances, run `configurations`, and `deploy code`.
* **On-Premises Support**
    * Unlike some AWS-only tools, OpsWorks can also `manage on-prem servers`.

## Use Cases
* `Consistent`, `automated` infrastructure configuration.
* `Managing complex`, multi-tier applications.
* When you already `use Chef or Puppet` and want AWS to manage it for you.
