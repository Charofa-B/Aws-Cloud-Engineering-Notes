# Reliability Vs Availability

## Reliability
* How `long` it can `keep working` without `errors` or failures.
* Focus on `consistency` and `continuity`

### How To Measure It
* `Mean Time Between Failures` (MTBF) = Total time in service ÷ Number of failures → probability of failure-free operation during a given period.
* Failure Rate = Number of failures ÷ Total time in service.

## Availability
* How much `time` the system is `up` and `running`
* The `percentage` of time the system is `operational` and `accessible`
* Focus on `Uptime`

### How To Measure It
* Availability `doesn’t measure` how well it `works`, just `whether` it’s `reachable`.
* Availability (%)= (Uptime ÷ (Uptime + Downtime)) × 100
